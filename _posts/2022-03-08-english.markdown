## love
When I told you that I missed you, I didn't mean to make you feel pressured.

Maybe we were meant to be together.

I'm not complete without you.

I'm better off because I had you in my life.

A home is more than bricks and mortar, it's a feeling of belonging, love, hope for the future.

Whoever breaks her's in for a wide ride.

Maybe this thing between us is clouding my judgment.

### seperate
What if I can't be the person that you need?

It okay to miss someone we've lost.

Although I take joy in thee, I take no joy of this contract tonight. It's too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.
It can be hard to face that my time with someone is coming to an end. Some times it's easier to just send them away before it hits you, like Juliet's doing.

I'm unsure what happens next. But endings are necessary for growth. No matter how painful they may be.

### death
I felt the weight of her death.

I think I just know how to deal with separate now, so it doesn't affect me as mush as it once did.

Those days are past us now.

## hard
I've tried harder at this than I ever have at anything.

## hope/faith
You had more faith than I did.

We need to hope destinies 命运 can be rewritten.

Now you are here in the faint hope 一线希望 I can alter it.

The future isn't set. There is still hope.

## possibility
Sometimes, great possiblities are right in front of us, and we don't see them, because we choose not to.
He took a leap, and it changed his life for the better.

## 随缘
Allowing events to unfold naturally turned out in our favor.

I'm gonna stay just the same 维持现状

## 面对
We have to live with the choices we make.

You're just postponing the inevitable. 推迟了不可避免的事

It's time to grow up and face the music(现实)

Life is beautiful and terrible, all at the same time. But if we're only living part of it, then we're not living at all.

## perfect
My country is by no means perfect, but at least we are free to criticize out government, vote in fair elections, and love whom we choose.

Sometimes, we screw things up for the better.

Sometimes things get messed up for the better.

I can’t see my way to a clear, definite ending for this plan. How do I act on a plan when I fell this doubt.

## pain / darkness
Pain is a great motivator 动力

Haven't all students of history? Those who suffer heal. Everything destoryed get rebuilt. And our towers grow a little taller every time.

Pain and darkness, it's a part of me. I need it to fuel（推动） me, to push me to be a better person.

This darkness will pass.

Some wounds are so deep, they never truly heal.

I have given in to my demons.

My upbringing（成长经历） was only dysfunction. But dysfunction doesn't get to choose who you are.

I always try and mask my pain in front of beautiful women, 'cause I thing it makes me seem more masculine.

No one is responsible for the family they are born into. All that matters is who they decide to be, and you've decided to be brave and big-hearted.

## fear
Ignorance breeds fear. 无知会产生恐惧

The fear that's spreading 扩散 in this country like wildfire 星火燎原 isn't because the president lied. It's because she comes from some place different.

A leader who caves 屈服 to fear is no leader at all.

I know what it's like to be scared. All of us do. But then, then an opportunity can present itself and like a switch, your whole world changes. And you find clarity and focus, and strength like you've never known 你从未感知过的力量.
So what I need you to do is just look out for that opportunity and trust it.

No matter how much we believe in ourselves, that never goes away. Not fully. Even now, I think I'm not afraid of anything. And then, something new and ugly rears its head and chasesme right back down the rabbit hole. But once we catch ourselves we have to jump right back out there.

It's love, but it's also deep fear. That's the depth of love we have for the people we care about the most. But it's a problem when that love stops someone from going after what they want for themselves.

I'm not afraid of enything. I just finally feel like the world is good. And I so badly want it to stay that way, even if it's just for a little while.

I was afraid to make wave 起冲突

Fear can create monsters where none existed before.

Fear makes us do a lot of things that we shouldn't.

Courage is the mastery of fear, not the absence of it.

I forgot what fear felt like.

### complicate
All I can say is that part of my life is very complicated.

The world is a much more complicated place than I realize.

### patience / slow
Greatness takes time. If a string（绳子） is in a knot, patience will untie it.

In my experience, the answers usually tend to come in time.

Sometimes you just have to slow down to get back to where you want to be.

A seedling's（幼苗） wait is over!

I'm just wondering if going after it now is premature（为时过早）
+ go after：追逐；追赶；寻找。
+ chase：爱情意义上的追求

## religion
We are all children in the eyes of God!

It's like I've gota deeper connection to religion than I've ever had.

In the Bible, it says that God created the world and saw that it was good. That is what you see when you look from stillness without thought.

### silence / 
True intelligence operates silently. Stillness is where creativity and solutions to problems are found.

I just needed to clear my head.

That's not a decision that can be made lightly.

It's hard to concentrate in these intense（紧张） situations.

#### 改变与适应
Things have changed.

Fitting in is hard enough, so many people telling you what to do and what to wear.

I was just starting to warm up to this place.

It's just a lot to take in right now.

Obviously, this is going to be a time of adjustment.

## thank / appreciate
Thank you god for this food are about to receive and for the nourishment of out bodies, and bless the hands that prepare it.

I guess this could all be mine someday.

## look forawad
what's done is done. All we can do now is look forward.

Instead of assigning blame, let's try to figure out what we're gonna do next.

## 冥想
There's nothing like a 20-second meditation micre-sesh to Zen out.

## trust
You just spent too much time with my sisters to be trusted.

## magic
Being yourself, that is a magic stronger than any wish.
Being truly okay with myself. Scars and all is how the right people truly found me.

A magician never reveals his secrets.

## 坦诚
I think that it's great that everything's just out there, right out in the open.

## 短句
Duty calls. 职责所在

No boats on or off.

### 名言
Kill two birds with one stone, as it were 可以说是
